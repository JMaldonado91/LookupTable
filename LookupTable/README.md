A brief description of your projectâ€™s purpose.:
A library of Tempur-Pedic mattress data, from 1992 to 2019.

Used: 
- Visual Studio 2017
- SQLite3 Studio


Run:

- SQLite3 Studio

I created a windows form for users to insert mattress data- mattress name, matress feel, height of the mattress, and year we had that mattress model available. Also on the form I have a refresh button where user clicks on to load all the data and after they insert new data they will see it loaded on the form.


Resources:
